        <!-- Description of what the website is about -->
        <p class="p1">Hello there, fellow AP Chinese student! I took this course and exam freshman year, and I'm here to share some advice to help you prepare. First off, let me explain why I created this website in the first place. 
          <br><br>
          This site is designed for those without a Chinese background who may find preparation more challenging. Having been in your position once, I understand the challenges you might face. Many of my peers struggled in this course, particularly with speaking and writing, which make up the free response section of the exam. My goal in with this site is to help improve students' organizational skills in writing and speaking Chinese, as well as to offer tips for the multiple choice section, all to help you maximize your AP score.
          <br><br>
          Explore the different tabs to find resources and tips to  prepare for the AP Chinese exam in May. With practice, determination, and a solid strategy, you can improve your score. Best of luck!</p>
